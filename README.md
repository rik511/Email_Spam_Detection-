**Email Spam Detection with Flask**

- **Description:** This project is a web-based email spam classifier built using Flask, designed to help users identify whether an email is spam or not. It employs a machine learning model based on the PassiveAggressiveClassifier and utilizes natural language processing techniques like tokenization, stemming, and CountVectorizer to preprocess and classify email text effectively.

**Key Features:**
user-friendly web interface for email classification.
utilizes a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not.
Text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization and stemming enhance classification accuracy.
built-in web server using Flask for seamless deployment.
easy integration with other web applications.

**Machine Learning Model:**
Model: PassiveAggressiveClassifier
Maximum Iterations: 50

**Technical Details:**
Python: Flask, Pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK
Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, Stemming
Vectorization: CountVectorizer
Web Framework: Flask
Deployment: Locally with Flask's built-in development server

This project aims to provide a practical solution for email spam detection through a user-friendly web interface while demonstrating the use of machine learning and NLP techniques in a Flask application.
